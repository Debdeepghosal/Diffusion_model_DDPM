# Diffusion Model with DDPM 🌐

This repository contains code and resources related to a diffusion model implemented using DDPM (Diffusion Probabilistic Models). The diffusion model is a powerful probabilistic generative model used in various machine learning applications, particularly in image generation, denoising, and data completion tasks.

## Overview ℹ️

The diffusion model implemented here leverages the DDPM framework, which models the diffusion process of a signal over a series of steps. It learns a generative process by estimating the conditional probability distribution of the signal at each step, given the previous steps. This model allows for high-quality sample generation, image completion, and denoising by iteratively refining the signal.

## Features ⚡️

- **DDPM Implementation:** Utilizes the DDPM framework for modeling the diffusion process.
- **Image Generation:** Generates high-quality images using the learned diffusion process.
- **Denoising and Completion:** Capable of denoising and completing corrupted or incomplete images.
- **Scalability:** Easily scalable to different types of signals and tasks.
